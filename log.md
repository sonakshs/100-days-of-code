# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with freeCodeCamp's 

**Thoughts:** I was really amazed that I learnt a few new basics related to HTML and CSS that I had no idea about earlier. Finished those two sections today. I completed 70 of 1408 coding challenges in the website. :D
